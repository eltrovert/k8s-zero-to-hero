# The Party Checklist:

<aside>
üí° What you need to know before taking off

</aside>

As a Kubernetes geek, I know that setting up the tech stack and prerequisites for a project can be a bit overwhelming, but don't worry, I'm here to make it as easy as possible for you.

## Kubernetes Cluster : The Party Ground

> Where all the Kubernetes component would dance around.
> 
- First things first, you're going to need a workstation. Now, I know some of you might be thinking "But KubeGeek, I don't have a fancy computer!" Well, fear not my friend, because a personal laptop or PC is recommended, but not required. You can use a virtual machine, tablet, phone, or any other device that allows you to connect to the Kubernetes cluster using **`kubectl`**. The installation process for **`kubectl`** will be explained in detail as one of the Party Ground Preparation, so don't worry about that.
- Next up, you're going to need a Kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes cluster is like the backbone of your project, it's a group of machines, called nodes, that are used to run containerized applications. These nodes are connected to a shared network and are able to communicate with each other in order to facilitate the deployment and scaling of applications. You have the option to set up a Kubernetes cluster through a cloud provider, or you can use a tool such as Minikube for local development on your own machine. Either way, having a Kubernetes cluster is essential for utilizing the powerful features and capabilities of Kubernetes in your application development and deployment process. And don't worry, detailed instructions for installing and setting up a Kubernetes cluster will also be available as a basic project. These instructions will provide step-by-step guidance to ensure that you are able to successfully set up and configure your own Kubernetes cluster, whether in the cloud or on a local machine.

### Party Ground Options

Alright party people, before we can get the party started, we need to choose the perfect party ground, a battlefield for our party members if you will. And as a Kubernetes geek, I have some recommendations for you.

- First up, we have the option of using a cloud provider for our party ground. This is a great option for those who want to have a larger party and don't want to worry about the logistics of setting up and maintaining the party ground themselves. Some popular cloud providers for hosting a Kubernetes party include AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Just make sure to read the fine print and choose the provider that best fits your party needs.
- Next, we have the option of using a tool such as Minikube for a more intimate, local development party. Minikube is a great option for those who want to host a smaller party and have more control over the party ground setup. It is easy to set up and use and you can even do it on your own machine if you want to.
- And last but not least, we have the option of using a bare-metal server for our party ground. This is a great option for those who want full control and flexibility over the party ground and don't mind getting their hands dirty with the setup process.

No matter which option you choose, detailed instructions for setting up and configuring your party ground will be available in Party Ground Setup Instruction. These instructions will provide step-by-step guidance to ensure that your party ground is ready for the ultimate Kubernetes party. So, choose your battle ground wisely, and let's get this party started!

## Docker Image: The Party Theme

Just like a party theme, a Docker image is a set of resources that are themed around a specific idea or concept. It includes all the resources needed to create a specific party atmosphere, such as decorations, music, and games.

A Docker image can be used to create a party atmosphere that is consistent and predictable, just like how a party theme does. It ensures that the resources that are needed for the party are available, and it guarantees that the resources will work in a consistent way.

Here‚Äôs a list of available public docker image that we can use:

1. Single-tier application:
    - Nginx: **[https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)**
    - Redis: **[https://hub.docker.com/_/redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)**
    - MongoDB: **[https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)**
2. Multi-tier application:
    - WordPress: **[https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress)**
    - Magento: **[https://hub.docker.com/r/magento/magento](https://hub.docker.com/r/magento/magento)**
    - LAMP stack: **[https://hub.docker.com/layers/bitnami/lamp/](https://hub.docker.com/layers/bitnami/lamp/)**

## Kubectl : The Essential Party-Toolkit

Kubectl is like the ultimate party toolkit for managing your Kubernetes cluster. Just as a party organizer has a set of tools to organize and manage the party, that tools would be `kubectl`. It has a set of commands to organize and manage your Kubernetes resources.

With `kubectl`, you can create, update, and delete resources such as pods, services, and deployments, just like how a party organizer can create, update, and delete the party's menu, decorations, and entertainment. You can also use `kubectl` to check the status of your resources and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. `kubectl` also allows you to scale your resources.

In short, kubectl is an essential tool for managing and maintaining your Kubernetes cluster, and it's a must-have tool for any Kubernetes party enthusiast. So, don't wait any longer and add kubectl to your Kubernetes toolkit today, and let the party begin!

Now let‚Äôs get this Party-Toolkit ready!

# Inside The Party

Welcome to the Kubernetes party ground! This is a place where all the magic happens, where different applications and services come together to create a seamless and enjoyable experience.

Inside this party ground, you'll find different sections, each with their own unique role and purpose. Just like how a party ground would have different sections for music, socializing, and different type of foods, Kubernetes has different components and layers that work together to make the overall experience happen. 

Here‚Äôs some activity I recommend at the start of the party

## Explore the Party Ground Architecture

In short, party ground are divides into two area, master nodes and worker nodes. the master nodes or control plane are like the party's main control center. The staff only building where all the important decisions are made, while the worker nodes are like the smaller rooms where the guests are having a good time. Together, they work to ensure that the party is running smoothly and that all the guests (or resources) are having a good time. 

This is an example of how all the organizer, guest, and party participant are communicating.

Let‚Äôs talk to each of those component and resource in Kubernetes cluster

### Control Plane: Staff Only Building

# Join The Party

Just like how a party starts with the basics and gradually becomes more advanced, learning Kubernetes follows the same pattern.

Imagine, at the beginning of the party, you start off with small talk, getting to know the other guests and setting the mood. In Kubernetes, this would be like learning the basics of containers and container orchestration. As the party progresses, you move on to dancing and having more fun, in Kubernetes, this would be like learning more advanced concepts such as scaling and self-healing.

By following this progression, you'll be able to fully understand and utilize the more advanced concepts, just as you would be able to fully enjoy and participate in the party as it progresses.

## Basic Level Party (Newbie)

At the basic level, you'll be introduced to the fundamentals of containers and container orchestration. This is like being introduced to the guests at the party and learning about their interests and background.

You'll learn about containerization and how it allows for applications to be packaged and deployed in a consistent and portable manner. This is like learning about the different types of food and drinks that will be served at the party and how they're prepared.

You'll also learn about container orchestration and how it allows for managing and scaling containerized applications. This is like learning about the entertainment and activities that will be provided at the party and how they're coordinated.

By understanding the basics, you'll have a solid foundation for learning more advanced concepts and fully participating in the Kubernetes party. So don't hesitate, join the party and have fun learning the basics of containers and container orchestration.

## Intermediate Level Projects

A common requirement in cloud-native applications is the ability to store and retrieve data. In Kubernetes, this can be achieved through the use of persistent volumes and persistent volume claims. 

A persistent volume is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator, and it can be used by pods to store data that needs to persist across pod restarts. A persistent volume claim is a request for storage by a user, and it allows a pod to access a specific persistent volume.

To use persistent storage in your Kubernetes applications, you will need to create a persistent volume and a persistent volume claim. You can then mount the persistent volume claim to a specific path in your application's pod, allowing it to access and store data on the persistent volume.

In addition to these native Kubernetes features, you can also integrate with third-party storage solutions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Store (EBS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Persistent Disk. This can be useful if you want to use a specific storage provider or if you need to access storage that is not available in your cluster. 

This is just one example of an intermediate Kubernetes project, but it demonstrates the power of the platform to provide advanced features for cloud-native applications. With Kubernetes, you can build highly available and scalable applications that can store and retrieve data in a reliable and efficient manner, with the added flexibility of being able to integrate with third-party storage solutions.

## Advanced Level Projects

A common challenge in modern software development is the need to integrate multiple systems and platforms in order to build a complete solution. This can be especially challenging in the context of Kubernetes, where you may be working with a complex network of containerized applications, microservices, and APIs. 

One example of an advanced Kubernetes project might be the deployment of a cloud-native e-commerce platform. This platform might include a web application, a database, a message queue, and multiple microservices that handle tasks such as payment processing and inventory management. Each of these components would need to be deployed to the cluster and integrated with one another in order to function correctly. 

To achieve this level of integration, you might need to use a variety of Kubernetes features and tools, such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. You might also need to integrate with third-party services such as databases, message brokers, and cloud storage providers. Managing all of these components and integration points can be a complex task, but it is one that is made much simpler by the powerful features and capabilities of Kubernetes.

This example illustrates the real-world complexity that can be addressed with Kubernetes. By leveraging the platform's ability to manage and orchestrate containerized applications at scale, you can build highly available, scalable, and reliable systems that can handle the demands of modern software development.
