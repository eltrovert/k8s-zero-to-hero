# Introduction

This repository contains a collection of real life Kubernetes projects that demonstrate how to use Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications. The projects use real life scenario with multi cloud infrastructure in consideration. The projects range from basic to advanced, a reason supporting the Zero to Hero in the repository name. You can use this repository for hands-on exercises on Kubernetes environment.

# Prerequisites & Tech Stack

Each project has its own set of prerequisites & tech stack explain in README file in each of the projects directory. However, in general you will need to setup the following tech stack and prerequisites:

Personal Laptop/PC is recommended but not mandatory, you can also use a VM, Tablet, Phone, etc, as long as you can connect to Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`.
- A Kubernetes cluster: You will need to set up a Kubernetes cluster in order to deploy your applications. You can use a cloud provider or a tool such as Minikube for local development.
- An application Docker image: You will need to prepare Docker image that contains a working application and all of its dependencies. You can either create a Dockerfile and package your own application, or use public application in DockerHub.

The repository will also provided a brief instruction about the prerequisites & tech stack environment setup.

# How to Use the Projects

It is highly recommended to start from the very basic projects to the intermediate and advanced. You can either clone this project to your local machine to get the files needed for the hands-on practice, or copy it one by one when you need it.
