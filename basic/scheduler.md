# Scheduler: The Party‚Äôs Attendant

**Scheduler :** Oh, excuse me! I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't help but notice that you seem a bit lost. Can I help you find your way? Are you looking for a specific area of the party or do you need assistance with something else?

**You:** Umm, I think I lost my way. Who are you? Can you show me around?

**Scheduler:**  Of course! I'm Kube-Scheduler, one of the key components of the Kubernetes party. I'm in charge of making sure that all the guests (pods) are placed in the right locations and that the partygoers (nodes) have the resources they need to keep the party going. I'm happy to show you around and help you navigate this exciting event.

First, let me explain a bit about the layout of the party. We have different sections, such as the pod section, where all the guests (pods) are located, the service section where we have the different services and the deployment section where all the deployment configurations are located.

If you're looking for a specific area or resource, just let me know, and I'll be happy to guide you there and give you more information about it. Also, if you need any help or have any question, don't hesitate to ask me, I'll be happy to assist you.

**You:** I have meet kube-api-server and kube-controller-manager, what do you call the room they're in?

**Scheduler:** The kube-api-server and kube-controller-manager are located in the control plane of the Kubernetes party.

The control plane is the brain of the party, it's where all the important decisions are made and where the state of the party is managed. The kube-api-server is responsible for receiving and handling API requests, while the kube-controller-manager is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the party.

Together, the kube-api-server and kube-controller-manager work to ensure that the party is running smoothly and that the guests (pods) are placed in the right location and that the partygoers (nodes) have the resources they need to keep the party going. It's like the control room of a party, where the party planner and the host are coordinating everything to make sure the guests are having a good time.

**You:** Umm, is there any other room aside from theirs?

**Scheduler:** Yes, there are several other rooms in the Kubernetes party aside from the control plane.

There's the worker nodes, which are where the guests (pods) are actually running. This is where the guests (pods) live and where they perform their specific tasks.

There's also the etcd, which is a distributed key-value store that holds the configuration data of the Kubernetes party. It's like a file room where all the important information of the party is stored and can be accessed by other components.

Additionally, there is the Kubernetes Dashboard, which is a web-based interface that allows you to interact with the Kubernetes API and view the state of the party. It's like a VIP room where you can see all the party details and have a better understanding of what's happening.

All these rooms play a critical role in the functioning of the party and work together to ensure that the party runs smoothly and that the guests (pods) are happy.

**********You:********** What room do you usually in?

**Scheduler:** I usually reside in the control plane of the Kubernetes party. The control plane is where all the important decisions are made. The kube-api-server, kube-controller-manager, and I work together to ensure that the party runs smoothly. However, i am also in constant communication with the other rooms such as the worker nodes, etcd, and Kubernetes Dashboard to make sure that the party is running smoothly and that the guests (pods) are happy.

**You:** Would you mind telling me the logic behind your work?

**Scheduler:**  I continuously monitors the state of the party, checking the available resources and constraints of the partygoers (nodes) and making decisions about where to place pods based on these factors.

I use algorithms and policies to make these decisions, such as the least-requested policy, which assigns pods to the partygoers (nodes) with the least amount of resources requested, or the binpacking policy, which assigns pods to the partygoers (nodes) with the most available resources.

I also take into account other constraints, such as affinity and anti-affinity rules, which specify whether certain pods should or should not be placed on the same partygoers (nodes) as other pods.

By continuously monitoring and adjusting the placement of the guests (pods) based on available resources and constraints, I am able to ensure that the party runs smoothly, that the guests are happy and that the partygoers have the resources they need to keep the party going.

**You:** Thanks for telling me those, now would you mind showing the way to ETCD?

**Scheduler:** Of course! The ETCD is a distributed key-value store that holds the configuration data of the Kubernetes party. It's like a file room where all the important information of the party is stored and can be accessed by other components. ETCD is one of the most important components in Kubernetes as it acts as the brain of the party. It stores the entire state of the party, and all components rely on it to function properly.

To get to the ETCD, you can simply follow the path of the control plane, where you previously met me, the kube-api-server, and kube-controller-manager. Once you're there, you can ask the kube-api-server to direct you to the ETCD. It's like asking the host of the party where the file room is located, they will guide you to the ETCD.

Keep in mind that ETCD is a critical component, so be sure to handle it with care, and always make sure to follow best practices when working with it.

<aside>
üÉè In my opinion, if scheduler were a person, it would be the type of person who is organized, detail-oriented, and efficient. It would be someone who takes charge and makes sure that things are running smoothly. It would be the one to make sure that everyone is in the right place at the right time and that everything is running according to plan.

It would be always thinking ahead and anticipating potential issues before they arise, so that I can quickly and effectively deal with any problems that may come up. I would be a great listener and communicator, and It would be able to work well with others to ensure that the party runs seamlessly.
